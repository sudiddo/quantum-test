### Feature

- Table with pagination, global search, options (edit and delete)
- Page 404 handler

## Installation

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
2. Run `yarn start` to start development server

## Dependency

This project use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/ "tailwindcss") to make development fast and easy, , the famous [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start "react-router-dom") for easy routing and [react-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/ "react-table") for headless-ui table.

### Notes

Since the type definition for react-table is not complete, I use any for some parts of the table. Will fix it as soon as they updated the type definition.
